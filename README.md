## How to Run the Game

**III. Creating a Game**  
You can create a game by clicking the ‚ÄúCreate Game‚Äù button on the Main Menu and defining how many people that will be the game and the category of the game.

**IV. Joining a Game**  
If one of your companions have created a game, you can simply join their game by clicking the ‚ÄúJoin Game‚Äù button and clicking their room ID.

**V. Game Proper**  
This game is played in a group (2 - 4 players). Each player is given the same set of words to guess, but the words are arranged randomly.

After ten (10) rounds, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins the game.
